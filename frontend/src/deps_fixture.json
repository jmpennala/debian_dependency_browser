An IO::String object can be attached to a string, and will make it possible to use the normal file operations for reading or writing data, as well as seeking to various locations of the string. The main reason you might want to do this, is if you have some other library module that only provide an interface to file handles, and you want to keep all the stuff in memory. . The IO::String module provide an interface compatible with IO::File as distributed with IO-1.20, but the following methods are not available; new_from_fd, fdopen, format_write, format_page_number, format_lines_per_page, format_lines_left, format_name, format_top_name.",
